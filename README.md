# Credit-Card-Checker

## Overview
A sequence of numbers can be verified as a valid Credit Card sequence using the [Luhn algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm#Description). Run [input_reader.js](https://github.com/dan-doyle/Credit-Card-Checker/blob/main/input_reader.js) to check the Credit Card validity of any sequence of numbers through the command line in Node.js. In addition, view [main.js](https://github.com/dan-doyle/Credit-Card-Checker/blob/main/main.js) for examples of both valid and invalid Credit Card numbers in `array` form.

## Learning Objectives
